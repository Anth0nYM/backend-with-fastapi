# Backend-with-fastapi [WiP🟡]

This repository contains all the code used in the immersive, hands-on backend development course built with FastAPI and developed by me.
The course is currently a work in progress. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts.
The first is the projects/ folder, which contains all the code projects, ranging from simple examples to more advanced applications.

The second is the units/ folder, which contains markdown files introducing useful concepts for building Python backends.

Each section has its own .md file with explanations.

I maintain this repository primarily for personal use, but I will be glad if it is helpful to you as well.
