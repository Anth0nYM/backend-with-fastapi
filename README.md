# backend-with-fastapi [WiP🟡]

This repository contains all the code used in the immersive, hands-on backend development course built with FastAPI.
The course is currently a work in progress. If you encounter any issue or have questions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## 🧱 Project Structure

Each unit of the course is organized as a subfolder in the main directory.
Every unit represents a small, self-contained project designed to teach a specific backend concept using FastAPI.

The structure follows a progressive learning path, starting from basic API design and evolving into more advanced topics such as authentication, databases, and application architecture.

### C1 — Introduction to FastAPI

C1 is the first chapter of the course.
The main goal here is to design a simple online forum using core FastAPI features.

- All the code for this chapter is located in `main.py`.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists all the dependencies needed to run the project.
- The focus of this unit is on:
  - Basic routing
  - Request/response models
  - Simple data structures
  - Project initialization and environment setup
