# Modern Python

Python has evolved to support the increasing complexity of modern applications, including web services, asynchronous communication, and type-driven validation.  
This chapter presents the essential tools and concepts required before working with FastAPI.

## 1. Essential Development Tools

### Python 3
Modern Python versions include important features such as type hints, asynchronous capabilities, and improved standard libraries.  
A recent version is recommended for backend development.

---

## 2. Package and Environment Management

### Package Managers
Python uses dedicated tools to install and maintain external libraries.  
The most common one is pip.

### Virtual Environments
Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, ensuring that each project uses the correct library versions without interfering with others.

### Poetry
Poetry is a modern tool that unifies dependency resolution, virtual environment creation, and project configuration.  
It manages packages and versions through a single configuration file and helps ensure reproducible environments.

## 3. Code Formatting
Maintaining consistent formatting avoids unnecessary disputes and improves readability.  
Automatic formatters (such as Black) are commonly used to standardize code style across a project.

---

## 4. Testing Tools
Testing is fundamental in professional development.  
Although Python includes a basic testing module, the broader Python community commonly uses more capable tools such as pytest, which integrate well with continuous integration systems.

---

## 5. Variables and Objects in Python
Python treats everything as an object.  
Objects carry identity, type, value, and reference count.  
Variables are not memory boxes; they are **names** associated with objects.  
When assigning a new value, Python may create a new object and redirect the name to it.

This model allows flexibility but requires developers to understand mutability, identity, and object behavior.

---

## 6. Type Hints
Python introduced type hints to allow developers to annotate variables and functions with expected types.  
Although these hints are not enforced during runtime, they offer several advantages:

- They help detect mistakes before execution.  
- They make large codebases easier to understand.  
- They allow frameworks such as FastAPI to automatically validate incoming data and generate documentation.

Type hints bring structure and clarity to Python’s flexible nature.

## 7. Data Structures
Python includes flexible built-in structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.  
Although powerful, these structures can become ambiguous in larger systems.  
In upcoming chapters, specialized model definitions will help ensure consistent and validated data exchange across the application.

## 8. Python Web Frameworks

### WSGI
A traditional synchronous interface used by earlier Python web frameworks.

### ASGI
A modern asynchronous interface designed for high-concurrency applications.  
FastAPI is built on ASGI, enabling better performance for large-scale systems.

### Django
A full-featured framework suited for data-driven, corporate, or monolithic applications.

### Flask
A minimalist microframework often used for smaller or more flexible systems.

### FastAPI
A newer framework based on Starlette (for web handling) and Pydantic (for data modelling).  
It emphasizes performance, validation, type safety, and automatic documentation.
